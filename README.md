Docker allows you to run the application in a containerized environment, isolating it from the underlying infrastructure and ensuring that it runs consistently across different systems.

By leveraging the Docker image for Linear Next, you can simplify the deployment process and quickly get Bimbel Linear up and running in your desired environment.

## Testing
We employ GitHub Actions CI for our testing processes, ensuring the quality and stability of our codebase. With GitHub Actions, we have established an automated testing workflow that runs various tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This continuous integration approach allows us to detect and address any issues or bugs early in the development cycle, maintaining the reliability and performance of our application. By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions CI, we streamline our testing procedures, enabling faster iterations and delivering a robust and dependable product to our users.
